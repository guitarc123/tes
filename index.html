<h3>McLaren 600LT</h3>

<h4> McLaren 570S and is the third Longtail model launched by McLaren. Power has been hiked by 30bhp to 592bhp courtesy of a freer-breathing exhaust, the springs are significantly stiffer, its dampers have been retuned and aggressive new bodywork has it generating even more downforce at speed. </h4>

<h3>AMG GT R </h3>

<h4>That it existed at all told you much about AMG’s determination, one day soon, to emerge from the shadows of its world-famous neighbour as a maker of sports cars of equal stature and acclaim.

    That emergence comes in the form of the GT Black Series, which appears to be an even hotter version of the GT R but is in fact quite a different beast altogether.</h4>

   <h3>BMW's M division has waited a long time to bring its CSL badge out of storage, and given how scintillating the E46-generation M3 CSL was (and still is, if you're courageous enough to ignore its value and take it for a blast), it sure sets some expectations.</h3>

   <h4>Roadsters are the vehicles closest to the traditional sports car definition. They are 2-door, 2-seat convertibles. The least practical of the sports car types, you buy one to have fun, get some sunshine on your face, and, sometimes, to show off. While typically expensive, finding a used luxury sports car under $40,000 is possible if you want luxury on a budget.</h4>

   <h4>Based on the Audi A5, the RS5 is the much sportier and hardcore version, which has become very sought-after in recent years.

    Newer versions of the RS5 come kitted-out with a 450hp twin-turbocharged V6 that’s supported by Audi’s excellent Quattro system, offering a 0-62mph time of just 3.9 seconds.</h4>

    <H4>Want a Lamborghini Huracan but can’t justify the price or impracticality of one? Well, that’s where the Audi R8 comes in.

        They’re both powered by the same 5.2-litre V10 engine, and both sit on the same platform. The only difference between the two is the exterior, interior, and badges – other than that they’re identical.</H4>
